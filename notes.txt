For years 1 to 3 can you alter it  so that there cannot be a movement between sets 1 & 4
In other words, from  set 1, moving to the next year, set 4 will not light up. And vice versa.

And can there should be only movement of one set between years 3 & 4
ie. set 2 in year 3 cannot move to set 4. Set 1 in year 3 can only move to set 2 etc
